# Signature Malleability

Surprisingly, signatures can be altered without the possession of the private key and still be valid.

That's what we are going to observe here.

The EVM specification defines several so-called 'precompiled' contracts one of them being

```
ecrecover
```

ecrecover() is a very useful Solidity function that allows the smart contract to validate that incoming data is properly signed an expected party.

It just executes the elliptic curve public key _recovery_.

So what is the vulnerability you may ask?

A malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create other valid signatures.

A system that performs signature verification on contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the signed message hash.

> Valid signatures could be created by a malicious user to replay previously signed messages.

Let's look at some code to spot where is exactly the problem:

```
function transfer(
        bytes _signature,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _gasPrice,
        uint256 _nonce)
    public
    returns (bool)
{
  bytes32 txid = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(getTransferHash(_to, _value, _gasPrice, _nonce), _signature));
  require(!signatureUsed[txid]);

  address from = recoverTransferPreSigned(_signature, _to, _value, _gasPrice, _nonce);

  require(balances[from] > _value);
  balances[from] -= _value;
  balances[_to] += _value;

  signatureUsed[txid] = true;
}
```

As you can see, here on this line:

```
  bytes32 txid = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(getTransferHash(_to, _value, _gasPrice, _nonce), _signature));
```

the txid is including the \_signature in the message hash to check if previously messages have been processed by this contract. That where the vulnerability lies.

But let's now focus on the ECDSA to understand the full picture.

Hereâ€™s the curve that is used for Ethereum (& BTC), which is Secp256k1.

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/secp256k1Curve.png>)

Secp256k1 defines a group of points, they are basically the points on the elliptic curve, and for each (x, y) combination x && y are elements of the field Zp, where Zp is a field for p prime.

This curve uses the following formula

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/curveFormula.png>)

```
p - prime number(a very large number)
n - order of the group(number of points on the EC)
```

Now, when we are signing a transaction, _we are making new random private key which is temporary_

This is extremely important to understand, becuase we want to achieve non-determinism in the ECDSA so the reverse engineering of the private key is impossible!

After this, we are using this this _temporary private key point_ to generate a corresponding P on the EC.

```
P = G,
where G is the generator point
(G = {x = 55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240, y = 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424}),
k is your temporary private key (a number in the range [1...n-1])
```

This P is the public key point that corresponds with our _temporary private key k_

Remember, P is a point. So from this P, we get the x-coordinate as our r value. In other words:

```
r = P's x coordinate
```

We are ready to calculate the signature proof. Let's see what is the formula:

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/signatureProofFormula.png>)

```
Where:
s - the signature proof,
z - the message hash,
r - P's x coordinate,
e - Our real private key,
k - our temporary private key.
n - prime order of the secp256k1 group
```

And if I can simplify this for you:

```
s = ((messageHash + P's x coordinate*your private key) + k^(-1)) (mod n)
```

And there you go, now we have the _r_ and _s_ values

But now, let's return for a bit to the _r_ value, like I said it was the x coordinate of the temporary public key.

Let's visualize this point on the curve now:

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/pointPonTheCurve.png>)

But if you think about it, the point P isn't the only point on the curve that has the same x'coordinate.

If we draw stright line from the x coordinate of point P up to the other side of the EC, we will observe that this straight line will intersect the EC at the exact x coordinate as point P.

So in a nutshell we will have other point P, let's call it P2 that has the same x coordinate, but with other y coordinate.

Let's take a look:

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/pointP2onTheCurve.png>)

And here comes variable _v_ in to the game.

The ECDSA has to know which point was used when creating the signature proof _s_ value so that the signer address can be recovered.

This is where the value _v_ comes in to play, it simply acts as an indicator for which side of the EC the actual public key that was used is on.

And here comes the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability

After we now have the two points P2 and P, we can compute a signature proof value for both of them hence we can make a double spending from a contract.

## Prevention

Before I tell you how to prevent this, you know that we found the _s value_ (the signature proof) for the point P. Well now an attacker could do the same thing but for the other point P2.

Essentially find the signature proof ot the point P2.

So this can be done by computing the _-s_

And since we are working in Zn, we can simply compute n-s and we have our attack s.

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/attackSignatureProof.png>)

And now after this exhausting load of information, how do we prevent this situation from occurring?

```
The most widely accepted fix is to limit the s value to the lower bound.
```

There are two s values that can be used to create a valid signature: _s_ and _n-s_.

Therefore there is one

```
s > n/2 
```

and another that is:

```
s < n/2
```

We have to limit the signature to use only the _s_ from a single side.

Let's see an example:

![Alt text](<../Common Attack Vectors/image/Signature Malleability/openZeppelinPreventionOfSignatureMalleability.png>)

This Open Zeppelin ECDSA library prevents this vulnerability from occuring by limiting _s_ value to the lower bound.
